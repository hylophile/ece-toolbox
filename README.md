# ece-toolbox
The goal of this project is to transcribe [Intro to ECE - Toolbox of Equations and Concepts](https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/5dtt6p/intro_to_ece_toolbox_of_equations_and_concepts/) written by reddit user ece35ta into a beautiful digital document via LaTeX and CircuiTekz.

The images are [here](https://imgur.com/a/kCt5O).

The basic plan is to first draw all the diagrams and formulas, and then see to the proper alignment / phrasing.
